    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <!-- IMAGE GOES HERE -->
    <p>I was born and raised in the Seattle area. I was previously employed working as an event security administrative supervisor contracted for Amazon. While I enjoyed my coworkers and the job, I knew there was not much more the job could offer in terms of career and personal growth. I left in order to pursue a new career which would offer opportunity to continuously learn and grow.</p>
